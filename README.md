## Just my personal GitHub page

This is a hub to my projects' GitHub pages.

### My projects

 * There's [Code>Zone](http://github.bobile.fr/CodeZone/)
 * Also, I created [Pyoro](https://github.com/thesola10/Pyoro) for the Arduboy!
 * If you're from EPITECH, you may want to check out this [easy installer](http://github.bobile.fr/kde-installer/) for a _guaranteed non-horrible_ desktop!
