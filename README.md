## Just my personal GitHub page

This is a hub to my projects' GitHub pages.

### My projects

 * I might be working on a [PictoChat](https://github.com/thesola10/PictoChat) library.
 * Also, I created [a Pyoro clone](https://github.com/thesola10/Pyoro) for the Arduboy!
 * If you're from EPITECH, you may want to check out this [easy installer](http://github.bobile.fr/kde-installer/) for a _guaranteed non-horrible_ desktop!
 * This [horrifying thing](https://github.com/thesola10/jeopardy)...
 * And a "To Be Continued" freeze-frame, coming to a Linux desktop [near you](https://github.com/thesola10/tobecont/)!
