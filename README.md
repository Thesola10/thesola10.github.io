### My projects

 * Also, I created [Pyoro](https://github.com/thesola10/Pyoro) for the Arduboy!
 * If you're from EPITECH, you may want to check out this [easy installer](http://github.bobile.fr/kde-installer/) for a _guaranteed non-horrible_ desktop!
 * This [horrifying thing](https://github.com/thesola10/jeopardy)...
 * And a "To Be Continued" freeze-frame, coming to a Linux desktop [near you](https://github.com/thesola10/tobecont/)!
